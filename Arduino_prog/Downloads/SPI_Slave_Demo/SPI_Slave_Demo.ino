/*
DAC _MCP4922 to DUE
This sketch allows you to interface the Arduino DUE with a DAC MCP4922.
The DAC needs a 16 bit word to work.
The first 4 bits are control bits and the remaining are bits which will contain
the value you want to send.
We have 12 bit available for our message so we will have a range of values between
0 and 4095.
 Connections
 ====================================================

 +5V > 4922 pin 1
 DUE pin CS > 4922 pin 3 (SS - slave select)
 DUE SCK > 4922 pin 4 (SCK - clock)
 DUE MOSI > 4922 pin 5 (MOSI - data out)
 Ground > 4922 pin 8 (LDAC)
 +3.3V > 4922 pin 11 (voltage ref DAC B)
 Ground > 4922 pin 12
 +3.3v > 4922 pin 13 (voltage ref DAC A)
 4922 pin 14 DAC A > 1k resistor > SignalOUT(you can put this signal in a
multimeter or oscilloscope to look at it)
 The other wire of the multimeter/oscilloscope should be at the same GND of the
Arduino

#include <SPI.h> // Include the SPI Library
// I suggest to give a first look to the following link:
// http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI
#define CS 52 // It can be 10,4, or 52 . Be careful if you use an Ethernet Shield
void setup() {
 // put your setup code here, to run once:
SPI.begin(CS);
SPI.setBitOrder(MSBFIRST);
pinMode(7,OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(7,HIGH);
/* Our DAC can operate at Mode 0,0 (which corresponds to mode 0 in the SPI
library) and in mode 1,1 (which corresponds to mode 3 in the SPI library) */
/* I don´t know why instead the DAC is working with the following instruction??
Everything works also without this instruction. I don´t know why!
it´s working just with modes 2 and 3. Maybe these mode 2 and 3 corresponds
to the mode 0,0 and 1,1 to which the MCP4922 datasheet is referring.
To understand what I´m talking about give a look to the following page:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus
in the section "Mode Numbers".
*/
SPI.setDataMode(CS, 2);
/*
From the datasheet we understand that the maximum frequency at which the DAC
can operate is 20MHz. The Arduino DUE has a system clock of 84MHz so if we don´t
say
anything to the SPI library it won´t change the clock at which we will operate.
84 MHz is too big for the DAC, to change this we can use the function
SPI.setClockDivider(SS,divider)
This function set the clock, for the device on pin SS, to 84/divider. The divider
variable
can only be an integer. For this reason for example to have an operating clock for
our device of 1MHz we 
will write: SPI.setClockDivider(SS,84);
to have an operating clock for our device of 2MHz we will write:
SPI.setClockDivider(SS,42); and so on.
By the way, seems that it works also without this instruction even if I have no
idea what happens internally
when you don´t specify the clock of the device. Maybe, I guess it goes up to the
maximum frequency of the DAC
but I´m not sure and for this reason I suggest to choose a frequency of operation
and fix it with the
instruction described before.
